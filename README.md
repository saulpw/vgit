# vgit v0.2.1

vgit is a sleek terminal user interface for git, supplanting the arcana of git command-line operations with intuitive keystrokes. It was built using the [VisiData tui](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v0.96/visidata/vdtui.py) as a platform.

Current features include:
- viewing, stashing, staging, unstaging, and committing of diff hunks.
- viewing the git log (history)
- branch and remotes management
- branch merges and commit cherry-picks
- popping, applying, and dropping of stashed diffs
- setting of local and global git config options
